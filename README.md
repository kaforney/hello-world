# hello-world
A space to store ideas and resources
I'm diving fast and furious into the world of web development, with a strong background in digital marketing and SEO. Currently working part-time as an SEO Strategist for an advertising agency in San Diego while I spend 20+ hours/week in class + online working to earn my 'Front End Web Development' certificate.
